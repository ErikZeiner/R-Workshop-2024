# R-Workshop-2024

The R workshop was a two-day event organised by the Fachschaft for General & Computational Linguistics at the University of TÃ¼bingen, of which I am a member. I lead the second day of the event, and took the attendees through a basic data analysis of linguistic data. I explained and demonstrated steps one needs to take before the actual analysis, as well as basic strategies and methods of looking at processed data.  Use of actual measurements to answer a research question from the field of Phonetics allowed the attendees to participate in a scenario similar to ones they might encounter as linguists. After the interactive session, the attendees solved exercises I prepared to try out newly introduced concepts.
